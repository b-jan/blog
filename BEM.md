CSS Methodology to like CSS for ever

I know several very talented developers often repeating they hate CSS.
In my experience, CSS is exactly like chemistry in high school,
if you do not take the time to learn it because you prefer mathematics (backend),
it will bring to you the most horrible moments of your student (developer) life.

Like chemistry when I was in high school, I started to learn CSS. The is not the prettiest language, I recognize,
but if there was one good investment in web development, one language that is still used after 20 years in web history, I named CSS.

The problem

CSS is not a complicated language, so why it is complicated to write CSS? Maintainability!
It is a nightmare to maintain poorly written CSS.
